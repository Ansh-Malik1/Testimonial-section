                heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
                for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled
                shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most
                grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve
                successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a

          <span class=rest>“ Before joining
            the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some
            structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by
            step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can
            only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and
            staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to
            wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
            outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no
            tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during
            interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly
            helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
            multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
